                                <li> Breeds with short coats can be brushed on a regular basis to keep them clean and to remove any dead coat. </li>
                                <li>Medium and long-coated breeds need more regular grooming, as they are more prone to knotting and their coats may also require trimming or clipping.</li>
                                <li>Dogs only need to be bathed every few months unless they have been swimming or have rolled in something smelly. Bathing your dog too often can have a detrimental effect on your dog’s coat as it can strip out any natural oils.</li>
